# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Hypothtically, this analysis is the brainchild of a UFO enthusiast who I follow along through her journey accessing and presenting UFO related data she found in a javascript file. This analysis looks at data stored in javascript related to UFOs and packages it for an interested audience.

However, that is simply the pre-text for the guided learning activity which culminates in this project. In this repository, I built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Then I created filters to make the aforementioned table fully dynamic, meaning that that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. Finally I customized the webpage using Bootstrap, and equipped the table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with my visualizations.

## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
